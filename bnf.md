# Syntax of SM based on SML97

This is the BNF syntax of SM Language, for the Compiler Design course, based 
on SML97 standard, contain only a subset and modified a little.

The first edition is called chrysanthemum.

## Literal Constant

1. Integer
	1. optional negation symbol (~)
	2. 0...9 sequence
	3. hexadecimal notation start with 0x, 0..9, a..f, A..F
	4. RE: INT = ~?(\d+)|(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)
2. Real
	1. A **Integer** in **decimal notation**, possibly followed by a point (.) .
	2. Followed by `E` or `e`.
	3. RE: REAL = ~?\d+(\.\d+)?([eE]~?\d+)
3. String
	1. between quotes (") , 0 or more printable characters, spaces or escape sequences.
	2. escape sequence with form `\ddd`, three digital.

## Comments

A comment is any character sequence within comment brackets (\* \*) in which comment brackets are properly nested. No space is allowed between the two characters which make up a comment bracket (* or \*). An unmatched (\* should be detected by the compiler.

	COMMENT_START = "(*"
	COMMENT_END = "*)"
	COMMENT -> COMMENT_START ANY_STRING COMMENT_END

## Identifier

There are syntactically two kinds of identifiers:

**Alphanumeric**: starts with a letter or prime (') and is followed by letters, digits, primes and underbars (_). 

Examples: abc, ABC123, Abc_123, 'a.


**Symbolic**: a sequence of the following

 	! % & $ # + - / : < = > ? @ \ ~ ` ^ | *
	
Examples: +=, <=, >>, $.

There are a number of different classes of identifiers, some of which have additional syntactic rules.

- Identifiers not starting with a prime.
value identifier (includes variables and constructors)
	- **type constructor**
	- **functor identifier**
- Identifiers starting with a prime.
	- **type variable**
- Identifiers not starting with a prime and numeric labels (1, 2, â€¦).
	- **record label**

Four types should be defined seperately.

## Lexical analysis

Each item of lexical analysis is either a reserved word, a numeric label, a special constant or a long identifier. Comments and formatting characters separate items (except within string constants) and are otherwise ignored. At each stage the longest next item is taken.
